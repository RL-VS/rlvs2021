I am an assistant professor in AI and Data Science at [ISAE-SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr).

My research focuses on bio-inspired artificial intelligence, namely genetic programming, neural networks, and the evolution of learning. I obtained my PhD at the Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (IRIT) on the evolution of design principles for artificial neural networks. Prior to that, I worked in the Anyscale Learning For All group in CSAIL, MIT, applying evolutionary strategies and developmental models to the problem of wind farm layout optimization.

I’m currently co-organizer of the Supaero Reinforcement Learning Initiative ([SuReLi](https://sureli.github.io)), head of the [Data & Decision Sciences](https://supaerodatascience.github.io/) Master’s program, and am a part of the Decision Systems research group in the Department of Complex Systems Engineering.
