I am a professor of Machine Learning and Optimization at [ISAE-SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr).

My research lies in the fields of Reinforcement Learning and Sequential Decision problems, with a broader interest for Machine Learning and Operations Research. I am the part of the "Decision Systems" research group within the [Department of Complex Systems Engineering](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/research/departments/department-of-complex-systems-engineering-disc-94/department-of-complex-systems-engineering-disc/) (DISC) and the founder and co-head of [SuReLI](https://SuReLI.github.io) (Supaero Reinforcement Learning Initiative).  
I created the [Data & Decision Sciences](https://SupaeroDataScience.github.io) MS curriculum and am implied more generally on (most) AI-related topics within the cursus.
