I am a professor of Machine Learning and Optimization at [ISAE-SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr).

My research lies in the fields of Reinforcement Learning and Sequential Decision problems, with a broader interest for Machine Learning and Operations Research. I am the part of the "Decision Systems" research group within the [Department of Complex Systems Engineering](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/research/departments/department-of-complex-systems-engineering-disc-94/department-of-complex-systems-engineering-disc/) (DISC) and the founder and co-head of [SuReLI (Supaero Reinforcement Learning Initiative)](https://SuReLI.github.io).  
I created the [Data & Decision Sciences](https://SupaeroDataScience.github.io) MS curriculum and have been implied more generally on (most) AI-related topics within the ISAE-SUPAERO cursus.  
My recent work has covered [non-negative transfer between RL environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05411), [risk-averse planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10090), and [a few](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2192437620301539) [applications](http://icrat.org/ICRAT/seminarContent/2020/papers/ICRAT2020_paper_24.pdf) at the interface between combinatorial optimization and ML. I am also currently interested in information disentanglement in RL, and neural consolidation processes for lifelong learning.
