# Frequently Asked Questions

## I couldn't register in time, can I still follow the talks?

Yes.  
Albeit we cannot accept any more registrations, we will publish the Zoom link to the school on our [front page](https://rlvs.aniti.fr). Through this link, anyone can attend classes even without being registered.  
The same link and all the school material will also be made available for everyone [here](https://rl-vs.github.io/rlvs2021).  
Keep an eye on either of these pages. There we will publish further instructions on how to follow lectures and interact in chat during the event.

## How do I log in to the chat sessions? Do I need to be a registered participant?

If you already have a Matrix.org account, please follow [these instructions](matrix/matrix_server.pdf). If you don't, please follow [these instructions](matrix/matrix.pdf). You don't need to be a registered participant for that.

## Can I get a certificate of attendance for RLVS?

We can issue certificates of *registration* (not attendance, since we cannot really check) for participants who registered through Whova. We will issue them after the school.
