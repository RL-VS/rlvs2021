# RLVS 2021

Welcome to the 2021 Reinforcement Learning Virtual School's website.

This edition is hosted by [ANITI](https://www.aniti.fr).  
Event website: [https://rlvs.aniti.fr](https://rlvs.aniti.fr).

## Goals of RLVS

RLVS intends to provide a high-quality, easy access to the field of Reinforcement Learning to new researchers. It aims to:
- Allow attendees to step in to the field of RL
- Learn from top lecturers in the field
- Provide broad access to live classes 

We expect the participants to be a mixture of masters and Ph.D. students, academics, and industrial researchers with a solid background in mathematics and computer science.
