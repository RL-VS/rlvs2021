# Monte Carlo Tree Search

## Abstract

Monte Carlo Tree Search is an algorithm for game tree search most famous for its application in AlphaGo. I will give a tutorial on this algorithm, which will include a significant practical component in Python. A very basic understanding of Python and Numpy will be useful for students wishing to complete the practical component independently.
