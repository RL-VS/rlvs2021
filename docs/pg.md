# From Policy Gradients to Actor Critic methods

## Abstract

Starting from the general policy search problem and direct policy search methods, I will give a didactical presentation of the Policy Gradient Theorem and explain some variants of the REINFORCE algorithm. From there, I will move step by step to presenting more advanced methods such as TRPO, PPO and Actor-Critic methods such as DDPG and SAC.
