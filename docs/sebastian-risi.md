I am an Artificial Intelligence researcher that aims to make machines more adaptive and creative. My research is focused on computational evolution, deep learning, and crowdsourcing, with applications in robotics, video games, design, and art.

My research asks questions such as: Can we create lifelong learning machines that continuously acquire new knowledge and skills? Can we create machines that learn from and work together with humans to solve tasks that neither humans nor machines can solve by themselves?

I co-direct the [Robotics, Evolution and Art Lab](https://real.itu.dk/) (REAL) at the [IT University of Copenhagen](https://www.itu.dk/), in which we explore such questions and are establishing new foundations for future robotics and other artificial cognitive systems. I am also one of the co-founders of [modl.ai](https://modl.ai/), a company that develops AI techniques for game development. Before joining the IT University I was a postdoctoral researcher in Hod Lipsonâ€™s [Creative Machines Lab](http://www.creativemachineslab.com/) at Cornell University. From 2008-2012, I was a PhD student in the [Evolutionary Complexity Research Group](http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/) at the University of Central Florida, headed by Kenneth Stanley.

Our research has been covered in different news outlets such as [Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/05/bored-your-video-game-artificial-intelligence-could-create-new-levels-fly), [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23531384-600-deepmind-dojo-will-train-ai-to-beat-human-players/), [Wired](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/smartwatch-typing-spying), [Popular Mechanics](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/news/a27311/1d-printing-robots/), [The Register](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/05/01/ai_can_generate_new_levels_for_classic_video_games_like_super_mario_and_doom/), and [Popular Science](http://www.popsci.com/g00/creative-ai-learns-to-sculpt-3d-printable-objects).
