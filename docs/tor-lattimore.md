I am a research scientist at DeepMind working mostly on decision making algorithms. I was previously an assistant professor at Indiana University, Bloomington and before that a postdoc at the University of Alberta. I received my PhD from the Australian National University under the supervision of Marcus Hutter. Together with Csaba Szepesvari I am the author of the book "Bandit Algorithms", which is published by Cambridge University Press and freely available at [http://banditalgs.com](http://banditalgs.com).
